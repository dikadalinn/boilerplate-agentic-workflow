# **03 \- Git Workflow & Collaboration Standards**

**Project Name:** \[Project Name\]

**Generated By:** @tech-lead

**Reference:** docs/01-system-context/06-DevOps.md

## **1\. Branching Strategy**

\<\!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Define the branching model (e.g., GitFlow, GitHub Flow, Trunk-based development). Specify the exact naming conventions for branches based on the table below. \--\>

* **Strategy:** \[e.g., Simplified GitFlow / GitHub Flow\]  
* **Main/Production Branch:** \[e.g., main / master\]  
* **Development/Integration Branch:** \[e.g., dev / staging\]

**Branch Naming Conventions:**

| Branch Type | Prefix / Pattern | Purpose & Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Feature** | feat/ | For new features. Example: feat/user-login |
| **Bug Fix** | fix/ | For resolving bugs. Example: fix/header-alignment |
| **Hotfix** | hotfix/ | Urgent fixes directly to production. Example: hotfix/payment-crash |
| **Chore** | chore/ | Maintenance, dependencies, config. Example: chore/update-tailwind |
| **Refactor** | refactor/ | Code structure changes without changing behavior. Example: refactor/auth-service |

## **2\. Commit Message Standards**

\<\!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Enforce the use of Conventional Commits to ensure a readable and parseable git history. Provide clear rules and examples. \--\>

All commit messages MUST follow the **Conventional Commits** specification. This allows for automated changelog generation and easier debugging.

**Format:** \<type\>(\<optional scope\>): \<description\>

**Allowed Types:**

| Type | When to use | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| feat | Adding a new feature | feat(auth): add google oauth provider |
| fix | Fixing a bug | fix(ui): resolve overlapping text on mobile |
| docs | Documentation changes | docs: update local setup guide |
| style | Formatting, missing semi colons, etc. | style: run prettier formatting |
| refactor | Refactoring production code | refactor(api): extract db connection logic |
| test | Adding missing tests, refactoring tests | test(auth): add unit tests for login |
| chore | Updating build tasks, package manager configs | chore(deps): bump react to v18 |

**Rules:**

* Description must be in lowercase.  
* Do not end the description with a period (.).  
* Use the imperative mood (e.g., "add" not "added" or "adds").

## **3\. Pull Request (PR) & Code Review Process**

\<\!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Define the mandatory checklist and rules that must be met before a PR can be merged into the main/dev branch. \--\>

Before a branch can be merged, the developer MUST open a Pull Request (PR). Direct pushes to the main or dev branches are strictly **FORBIDDEN**.

**Mandatory PR Checklist:**

* \[ \] **Self-Review:** Developer has reviewed their own code before submitting.  
* \[ \] **Tests Pass:** All unit and E2E tests pass locally.  
* \[ \] **No Linter Warnings:** npm run lint yields zero warnings or errors.  
* \[ \] **Edge Cases Handled:** Code accounts for scenarios defined in 07-Edge-Cases.md.  
* \[ \] **UI States Complete:** Loading, Empty, and Error states are implemented as per 03-UI-States.md.

**Approval Requirements:**

* Minimum of \[e.g., 1\] approval from a Lead/Senior Developer (@tech-lead) is required.  
* All CI/CD pipeline checks (e.g., GitHub Actions) MUST pass green.

## **4\. Conflict Resolution Protocol**

\<\!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Briefly outline the steps a developer must take if they encounter a merge conflict. \--\>

1. Fetch and merge the latest target branch (e.g., dev) into your working branch.  
2. Resolve conflicts locally using your IDE (e.g., VS Code).  
3. Test the application locally to ensure the resolution did not break existing functionality.  
4. Commit the resolved changes and push to update the PR.

# **02 \- Agile User Stories & Acceptance Criteria**

**Project Name:** \[Project Name\]

**Generated By:** @product-manager

**Reference:** docs/00-business-context/01-BRD.md, docs/02-product-context/01-PRD.md

## **1\. Overview**

\<\!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Write a brief summary explaining that this document defines the exact behavioral requirements and the "Definition of Done" for the engineering team, based on the approved PRD. \--\>

\[User Stories Overview\]

## **2\. Epic: \[Epic Name 1, e.g., Authentication & Onboarding\]**

\<\!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Group User Stories logically into "Epics" (large bodies of work). Extract these Epics based on the core features in the PRD. \--\>

### **2.1 \[Story ID, e.g., US-1.1\]: \[Story Title, e.g., User Login\]**

\<\!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Write the User Story using the strict Agile format. The Persona MUST match those defined in the PRD/BRD. \--\>

* **Story:** As a **\[Persona\]**, I want to **\[Action\]**, so that **\[Benefit/Value\]**.  
* **Priority:** \[High / Medium / Low\] (Based on MVP requirements)

**Acceptance Criteria (AC):**

\<\!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Write clear, testable Acceptance Criteria using a checklist format. You MUST include both the 'Happy Path' (success) and 'Negative Flow' (error handling). Minimum 3 ACs per story. \--\>

* \[ \] **AC 1 (Happy Path):** \[e.g., Given the user enters a registered email and correct password, when they click 'Login', then they are authenticated and redirected to the Main Dashboard.\]  
* \[ \] **AC 2 (Negative Flow):** \[e.g., Given the user enters an incorrect password, when they click 'Login', then a red error message "Invalid credentials" is displayed and the password field is cleared.\]  
* \[ \] **AC 3 (UI/State):** \[e.g., When the 'Login' button is clicked, it must show a loading spinner and become disabled to prevent double-submissions.\]

**Technical & Design Notes:**

\<\!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Add brief notes referencing constraints from the System Context or UI design instructions. \--\>

* \[e.g., Password must be masked (\*\*\*) during input. Ensure JWT token is stored securely upon success.\]

### **2.2 \[Story ID, e.g., US-1.2\]: \[Story Title\]**

\<\!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Generate the next User Story within this Epic following the exact same structure as above. \--\>

* **Story:** As a **\[Persona\]**, I want to **\[Action\]**, so that **\[Benefit/Value\]**.  
* **Priority:** \[Priority\]

**Acceptance Criteria (AC):**

* \[ \] **AC 1:** \[Criteria\]  
* \[ \] **AC 2:** \[Criteria\]

**Technical & Design Notes:**

* \[Notes\]

## **3\. Epic: \[Epic Name 2, e.g., Core Feature Operations\]**

\<\!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Create the next Epic and generate its corresponding User Stories. Ensure ALL MVP features from the BRD and PRD are covered with detailed ACs. \--\>

### **3.1 \[Story ID\]: \[Story Title\]**

* **Story:** As a **\[Persona\]**, I want to **\[Action\]**, so that **\[Benefit/Value\]**.  
* **Priority:** \[Priority\]

**Acceptance Criteria (AC):**

* \[ \] **AC 1:** \[Criteria\]  
* \[ \] **AC 2:** \[Criteria\]

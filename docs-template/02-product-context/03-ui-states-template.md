## **1\. Overview**

\<\!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Provide a brief summary of why defining UI states is critical for the user experience in this specific application. Emphasize the goal of preventing the app from looking "broken" during loading or error conditions. \--\>

\[UI States Overview\]

## **2\. Loading States**

\<\!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Define how the application behaves while waiting for data from the backend. Categorize this by interaction type (e.g., Initial Page Load vs. Button Submit). \--\>

### **2.1 Full Page / Initial Load**

* **Behavior:** \[e.g., Display a centralized brand-colored spinner or a splash screen.\]  
* **Applied To:** \[e.g., The first time the user opens the web app or hard-refreshes the page.\]

### **2.2 Content / Data Load (Skeleton Screens)**

* **Behavior:** \[e.g., Display Skeleton Loaders (gray pulsing rectangles) that mimic the shape of the content to come.\]  
* **Applied To:** \[e.g., The Main Dashboard data table, the Project Detail card.\]

### **2.3 Interaction / Action Load**

* **Behavior:** \[e.g., The clicked button MUST change its text to "Loading...", show an inline spinner, and become disabled to prevent duplicate submissions.\]  
* **Applied To:** \[e.g., All form submissions, such as the "Login" or "Create Project" buttons.\]

## **3\. Empty States (Zero Data)**

\<\!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Define what the user sees when there is no data to display. This is crucial for onboarding new users. A good empty state MUST have an illustration/icon, a friendly message, and a clear Call-to-Action (CTA). Generate specific empty states based on the core screens defined in the PRD. \--\>

### **3.1 \[Screen Name, e.g., Dashboard / Projects List\] Empty State**

* **Visual/Icon:** \[e.g., A faded illustration of an empty folder or a clipboard.\]  
* **Message:** \[e.g., "You haven't created any projects yet."\]  
* **Call to Action (CTA):** \[e.g., A prominent primary button saying "+ Create Your First Project" that opens the creation modal.\]

### **3.2 \[Screen Name, e.g., Search Results\] Empty State**

* **Visual/Icon:** \[e.g., An illustration of a magnifying glass with a question mark.\]  
* **Message:** \[e.g., "No results found for '\[Search Term\]'. Try adjusting your filters."\]  
* **Call to Action (CTA):** \[e.g., A secondary button saying "Clear Filters".\]

\<\!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Add more specific Empty States if the PRD dictates other lists or data views (e.g., Empty Inbox, Empty Notifications). \--\>

## **4\. Error States**

\<\!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Define how the UI handles and displays errors to the user. Differentiate between global errors, inline form errors, and network errors. \--\>

### **4.1 Inline Form Validation Errors**

* **Behavior:** \[e.g., The input border turns red (e.g., border-red-500). A small red text message appears directly below the input field.\]  
* **Message Example:** \[e.g., "Password must be at least 8 characters long."\]

### **4.2 Global / Action Errors (Toast Notifications)**

* **Behavior:** \[e.g., Display a destructive (red) Toast Notification in the top-right corner. It should auto-dismiss after 5 seconds.\]  
* **Applied To:** \[e.g., Failed API submissions, such as "Invalid email or password" during login, or "Failed to delete project".\]

### **4.3 Network / Critical Failure (500 Error)**

* **Behavior:** \[e.g., Display a full-screen or full-section fallback UI (Error Boundary).\]  
* **Message:** \[e.g., "Oops\! Something went wrong on our end. Please try refreshing the page."\]  
* **Call to Action (CTA):** \[e.g., "Refresh Page" button.\]

## **5\. Success & Feedback States**

\<\!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Define how the user is notified when an action is successful. \--\>

* **Behavior:** \[e.g., Display a success (green) Toast Notification at the bottom-center of the screen. Auto-dismiss after 3 seconds.\]  
* **Applied To:** \[e.g., "Project successfully created", "Profile updated", "Link copied to clipboard".\]

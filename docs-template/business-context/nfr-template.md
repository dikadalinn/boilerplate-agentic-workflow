# **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)**

**Project Name:** [Project Name]

**Generated By:** @Business_Analyst

**Reference:** docs/01-business/01-BRD.md, docs/00-inbox/idea-scratchpad.md

## **1. Overview**

<!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Write a short paragraph explaining that this document contains the quality standards, performance, and technical limitations that the development team must adhere to (Phase 3) based on the MVP scope in the BRD document. -->

[Brief introduction]

## **2. Performance & Responsiveness**

<!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Define performance expectations in measurable NUMBERS. Do not use ambiguous words like "must be fast". Mention the Page Load Time limit, API response time limit, and how the system handles heavy processing (e.g., background/asynchronous processing). -->

* **Page Load Time:** [Example: Maximum 2 seconds on a 4G network]
* **API Response Time:** [Example: Maximum 500ms for standard queries]
* **Heavy Processing:** [Handling for heavy features present in the BRD, e.g., file upload or data export]

## **3. Scalability & Capacity**

<!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Determine the user and data capacity targets for the MVP phase. What is the estimated number of concurrent users? What is the data storage limit per user/project, if any? -->

* **Concurrent Users:** [Example: Capable of handling 1,000 active concurrent users]
* **Data Growth Target:** [Example: Designed to accommodate 1 million data records in the first 6 months without performance degradation]

## **4. Security & Data Privacy**

<!-- AI INSTRUCTION: This is very important for SaaS. Explain the data isolation strategy (Multi-Tenancy), encryption standards (Data in Transit & Data at Rest), authentication, and regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, or password encryption standards). -->

* **Data Isolation:** [Example: Strict data isolation between tenants/projects. User A must not be able to see User B's data]
* **Encryption:** [Example: Mandatory HTTPS/TLS 1.2+, hash passwords using bcrypt/Argon2]
* **Compliance:** [Data privacy rules to be followed]

## **5. Availability & Reliability**

<!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Define the Service Level Agreement (SLA) or service availability target. Also, define the backup and data recovery strategy. -->

* **Uptime Target:** [Example: 99.9% uptime per month]
* **Backup Strategy:** [Example: Automated daily backups with a 30-day retention period]

## **6. Usability & Accessibility**

<!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Determine which platforms must be supported. Is it Mobile-first? Which browsers are officially supported? Is specific accessibility support needed (WCAG)? -->

* **Device Support:** [Example: Desktop & Tablet web browsers. Mobile view is optional for MVP]
* **Browser Support:** [Example: 3 latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari]

## **7. Maintainability & Logging**

<!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Explain expectations for error tracking and activity history (Audit Trails) to facilitate future debugging by the technical team. -->

* **Audit Trails:** [Example: The system must log critical activities such as data deletion or access rights changes]
* **Error Tracking:** [Example: All unhandled exceptions must be caught and sent to a centralized logging service]

[Brief monetization introduction]

## **2. Pricing Model Strategy**

<!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Define the pricing model. Is it "Per User/Seat" (pay based on the number of staff), "Flat Monthly" (fixed payment for all features), or "Usage-Based" (pay based on the amount of data/leads)? -->

* **Main Strategy:** [Mention the model]
* **Billing Cycle:** [Example: Monthly and Annually with a 20% discount]

<!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Create a minimum of 3 subscription tiers (e.g., Basic/Free, Pro, Enterprise). Define the prices and main features for each tier. Use the table below and fill it with SPECIFIC limits (using NUMBERS). -->

| Feature / Limitation | Tier 1: [Example: Starter] | Tier 2: [Example: Professional] | Tier 3: [Example: Enterprise] |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Price (Monthly)** | [Example: $0 / Free] | [Example: $29] | [Example: Custom Pricing] |
| **Max Users / Seats** | [Example: 1 User] | [Example: 5 Users] | [Example: Unlimited] |

<!-- AI INSTRUCTION: Provide a technical explanation from a business perspective on what happens if users hit their limitation threshold (Quota Exceeded). -->

* **Upgrade Prompt:** [Example: If a Starter user tries to add a 2nd Project, the system will display an upgrade offer modal popup to the Professional plan].
* **Downgrade Policy:** [Example: If a user downgrades from Pro to Starter, remaining projects are not deleted but are frozen (Read-only) until they upgrade again].

## **5. Payment Gateway Assumptions**
